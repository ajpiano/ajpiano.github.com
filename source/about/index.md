I am adam j. sontag. I'm a programmer at the Boston based webshop/hack-space bocoup. I am passionate about JavaScript and jQuery. I am a member of the jQuery UI team, and a co-host of the yayQuery Podcast, an informal chit-chat about JavaScript. You can usually find me hanging out in #jquery on freenode. If I'm not there, I'm probably running around New York City with my band, Bellevue's Finest.
