Welcome to this useful website about me, adam j. sontag. If you met me in real
life, you would totally be like, "Now here's a guy who would set up a github
pages site just so he could test out [Octopress](http://octopress.org)."
Normally, I'm offended by prejudice in all forms, but in this case, you would
be right so I wouldn't talk shit back to you.
